## Prerequisites

Please answer the following questions for yourself before submitting an issue.

- [ ] I am running the latest version
- [ ] I checked the documentation and examples and found no answer
- [ ] I checked that this isn't an [ImageMagick](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick) bug itself, and is an actual problem with this specific library, and the bug is not present in the official imagemagick
- [ ] I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed
- [ ] I'm reporting the issue to the correct repository. E.g, report kmagick bugs to the kmagick repo
- [ ] I'm using the correct architecture (e.g. an x86 emulator runs x86, not arm). The binary produced here runs on arm64
